## Discord Translator v3 – Important Update Notice

We’ve released a major update to **Discord Translator**, which may require some users to take action.
You might encounter one of the following issues:

### Possible Issues

1. License becomes invalid
2. Discord Translator stops working properly
3. Translation service settings missing or not working after upgrading to v3
   (Because v3 uses a completely new configuration format)
4. Previous configuration fails to migrate due to major changes in v3

If you experience any of these problems, please follow the steps below:

### 1. License Invalid

Please follow the official guide to reset your license:
https://doc.codecode.me/troubleshooting/how-to-reset-license

### 2. Discord Translator Not Working

<Tip>
  After updating the extension, if Discord Translator doesn’t work correctly, please try the following steps:

2. If the issue persists, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

</Tip>

5. Activate premium features
   https://doc.codecode.me/troubleshooting/how-to-active-premium-features

### 3. Translation Service Configuration Issues After Upgrading to v3

Because the translation service configuration format in **v3** is different from **v2**, automatic migration is not possible.
To restore your settings:

1. Go to **Discord Translator Full Settings → v2 Settings**
2. Locate your previous translation service configuration information
3. Manually reconfigure your translation service in v3 using the same details

If no data appears in **v2 Settings**, please reconfigure your translation service from scratch.
We have tested extensively, but in rare cases some data may still fail to load. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

### 4. Previous Configuration Fails to Migrate

Due to significant changes in the configuration system of **Discord Translator v3**, your previous settings may not migrate successfully.
After updating the extension, **please go to the settings page and reset your configuration**.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
