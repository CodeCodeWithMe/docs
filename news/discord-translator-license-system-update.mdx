Dear User,

We are pleased to announce that **Discord Translator** has been updated to **version 2.3.0**.
Starting from this version, all new license activations and purchases are now managed through our new platform, **Creem**.

## Licensing Information

- **Licenses purchased via Creem** require **Discord Translator v2.3.0 or later**.
- **Old licenses** (purchased through Lemon Squeezy) will continue to work, but you may encounter activation issues after upgrading.
  If that happens, please follow the instructions below to resolve the issue.

## How to Fix License Issues

If you experience any license-related problems, try one of the following methods:

1. **Deactivate and Reactivate Your License**
   Open the license page in the plugin, deactivate your current license, and then activate it again.

2. **Reset Your License**
   Enter the email address and license key you used when purchasing the product, then click the **Reset License** button.

3. **Reinstall and Reset Again**
   If the issue persists, reset the license as described above, then reinstall the plugin and activate again.
