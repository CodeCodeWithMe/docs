Dear User,

We would like to inform you that we have officially migrated our payment and licensing system from **Lemon Squeezy** to **Creem**.

## Why We Made This Change

After using Lemon Squeezy for some time, we encountered several serious issues with their customer support and communication:

1. **Extremely Slow or No Response**
   When we contacted Lemon Squeezy regarding important payment and tax-related issues, their support team often took a very long time to reply, or never replied at all.

2. **Unresponsive on Multiple Channels**
   We reached out to them via Twitter (X) and email, but received no meaningful response or assistance.

3. **Poor Communication Experience**
   These delays caused unnecessary stress and made it difficult for us to resolve critical issues in time.

Due to these repeated problems, we decided to switch to **Creem**, a more reliable and responsive payment platform.
Our goal is to ensure a smoother experience for all users, with faster support and more stable service.

## What This Means for You

- All future purchases and license management are now handled through **Creem**.
- Your existing licenses and subscriptions will continue to work normally.
- You do not need to take any action unless you encounter issues with license activation.

## Support

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please contact us at **support@codecode.me**.

We are always happy to assist you.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

**â€“ The CodeCode Team**
