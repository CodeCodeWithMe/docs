## Options Page

### General

<Tip>
It is recommended to enable the auto-update feature.

When the browser extension is updated, it may lose communication with WhatsApp Web, and you will need to manually refresh the page to restore normal communication.

With auto-update enabled, everything will be handled automatically.

Note:
When auto-update is enabled, WhatsApp Web will automatically refresh when the extension updates.

You need to enable the rule (Running) for it to take effect. By default, the
rule is disabled (Stopped).

When you delete a rule, all data matching that rule will be deleted and cannot be recovered. Please be cautious.
